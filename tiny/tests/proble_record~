e02: Still works as outputing weird char              Delete the Tree File?    / Fatal Error?        O How to end and don't move into CG?
e03: Can't swap with a const                                                                         O 
e04: Constants can't be assigned a type;One More Error Here in Assignment                            O 
e05: Should point out 2 errors in case statement                                                     O 
e07: Can't read for a for loop control variable(we may handle this as in Assignment or Swap)         O 
e10: We are not allowed to output enum type(As now we do trivial)                                    O
e11: In const,  foo = foo not allowed                                                                O
e13: Can't swap with a const                                                                         O
e15: Can't deal with const k = integer								     O
e16: Can't assign to a const value, Range operands should be same type                               O
e18: What's the meaning of that statement?                                                           O
e23: Can't output Boolean Type, while boolean is type enum					     O
e25: Can't output an enum type                                                                       O
e26: Can't output an enum type									     O
e27: Can't output an enum type									     O
e28: Type mismatch in case statement                                                                 O 

PS: 
1. Change Association Operators's Hint from "must be type int" to "Not Compatible" 
2. How to End the Execution and don't move into CG? -- Maybe we can set a flag variable as "fatal error flag", if it is true then we delete the 
   tree file at the end of the execution of Constrainer.   ---> Just Don't Run In CG
3. CaseExp should be global, or it will be changed after processNode, cause type3 is a local variable, in ProcessNode(){}, the value will be    
   changed!
4. "error in output !! single quotes for strings", what's the meanning?  --> Screw it
5. Many "AT L0/C0", WTF?  X
6. Still, what about the /t?
